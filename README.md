# F1 Webscraper for 2022 Season
A simple python project that scrapes race, team, and driver data from the Formula 1 website.

## Description
This is a simple python project that scrapes data from various pages on the Formula 1 website. The data is parsed using the requests and bs4 python libraries. The data is taken from the website and stored in a dataframe using the pandas python library. These dataframes are then formatted and exported/written to several excel files created at runtime. Some example excel files are stored in the repo.

## Getting Started
* Make sure that you have the latest version of python installed on your computer
* Download the main.py file from the repo and prepare to run it on your machine
* Before running the .py file, make sure you have the "requests", "bs4", "pandas", and "openpyxl" python packages installed
* Run the main.py program - excel files will be created and populated with the data pulled from the various F1 webpages
